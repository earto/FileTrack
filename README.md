# FileTrack

A Home Assistant custom component that monitors folders and exposes a `fileList` sensor attribute — designed as a companion for the [Camera Gallery Card](https://github.com/TheScubadiver/camera-gallery-card).

## Installation

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Download **FileTrack** via HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → FileTrack** — completes instantly, no configuration needed

## Usage

Sensors are created directly from the **Camera Gallery Card editor** — no YAML, no manual setup.
